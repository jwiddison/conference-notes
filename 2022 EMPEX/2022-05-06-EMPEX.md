## Brooklyn Zelenka - The Escape from Flatland

There's some value in thinking of building "micro languages" in existing languages.
Building embedded DSLs can make things more expressive and help people fall into the pit of success.

Fun aside, Pokemon Yellow is Turing Complete.

BUT, the more expressive a language is, the harder it can be to understand.

There is a meaningful distinction between discovering something and inventing something (at least
according to Turing)

Look at the Church-Rosser theorum about coordination / ordering for parts of a process that are a
subet of the top-level.

Try and reduce the coordiantion between concurrent processes to be as minimal as possible.
Which is effectively what a transaction is.

Languages are tools that help you think about solving problems.
Changing the language to have the vocabulary you want makes it more likely that you say the right thing. 

### TL;DR

Embedded DSLs are nice.
Delay your side-effects to as late in the process as possible.
Try and move towards a transaction-like semantic when coordinating among parallel processes.

## Mat Trudel - A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Phoenix

What's underneath Phoenix?
- Plug.
What's underneath Plug?
- A plug-aware HTTP server.
- Has traditionally been cowboy. Phoenix starts a cowboy server as one of its supervised children.

Talking about ![Bandit](https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit), which is a rip/replace for Cowboy.
Cowboy is implemented in Erlang.
Bandit is fully elixir-native. With `0.5.0` which comes out today, it'll support the full HTTP spec,
just not sockets yet, but anything for API/HTTP server is g2g.
Can be up to 5x faster than Cowboy.

Cowboy is a "plug-aware" HTTP server
Bandit is a "plug-native" HTTP server

![Thousand Island](https://github.com/mtrudel/thousand_island) is a 100%-elixir native socket server.

Consider using `Task` as an interesting alternative to `GenServer`.
If there's no need for other modules to communicate with your long-running thing, `Task` might be a good alternative to `GenServer`.

## Digit - Burrito: Wrap your app in a BEAM burrito!

Talking about ![Burrito](https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito).
I'm sure this is actually amazing / fascinating, but I'm looking into a prod issue at the moment.
