# Ruby Hack 2019

Thursday April 4, 2019 - "Matz is nice, so we are nice"

## Ruby3: What's Missing? - Yukihiro (Matz) Matsumoto

### *Ruby is Good*

Designing a programing language is like designing human thought.
It was designed so that it would be fun to write.
He built Ruby because it was fun. He wanted to try and design it to match the way programmers think.
The goal of ruby is to "make programmers happy"

### *Ruby is Bad*

- Performance
- Multi-core workloads
- Scaling to big teams

### *Ruby is "Good Enough"*

For Github, Aribnb, Instacart, Cookpad. And tons of other people. If its good enough for them, its good enough for your service to be written in Ruby. Ruby exists to get you to the point where you can succeed.
Think of twitter. Ruby helped Twitter come to be, and get to the point of being successful enough to have the need and the luxury to re-write things with more performant technologies.

### Ruby 3 is coming late next year. What will it do better?

- Memory Usage!! Lots of work is going into improving garbage collection. Helps solve the memory bottleneck.
- Also working on the CPU and I/O bottlenecks
- Ruby 2.6 runs 8x faster than Ruby 2.0
  - This isn't true for rails though. All of the "Just-in-time" compiling doesn't really help in a rails environment because there are just too many methods. The JIT performance is promising but not for rails yet.
- Web is now a multi-core aware environment. They're working on threading and optimising for I/O intensive tasks.
- How are they solving the big teams problem?
  - Static typing! They're going to add Type Definition Syntax files (.rbi files).  Kind of like the typespecs in elixir.
  - There will be an automatic type profiler that can run for you and generate .rbi files
  - There are going to be more ways to catch type errors!
- They won't introduce braking changes if they can help it, unless you're doing bad things.
- Right now positional vs keyword args for functions kind of sucks.  The way its currently implmented using a hash won't work with typechecking.  That might be the only major breaking change with Ruby 3.0
- Adding an implicit block argument. Every method takes a block, and they're adding an operator to catch it so you can do things like this:

```rb
# The @1 stands in for the block.
[1,2,3].map(@1 * 2)
```

- Pattern matching is coming, but only for case statements (not function overloading)

Ruby does need to survive.  It doesn't have to be the best or fastest language.  It does need to survive though.
