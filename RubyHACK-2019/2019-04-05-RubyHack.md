Morning Talks

## A Rubyist's Survival Guide to Elixir and Phoenix - Benjamin Porter

Why is scaling ruby hard? The primary way is to scale horizontally, and that can be expensive.
One way to scale is by multi-threading and lots of gems are not thread safe.
Elixir loses out to Go, Rust, etc in CPU intesive tasks UNLESS they're parallelizable
You can do a lot of functional things in Ruby without needing to switch to something like Elixir

Things that elixir does:

- Immutability
  - Elixir forces immutability, which Ruby, and a lot of other languages don't
  - Every time you change variables, you get a copy back, not a mutated original
- Functional!
  - Declarative, rather than imperative
  - Idemoptent, eliminates side effects. Function outputs depend ONLY on function inputs
  - Has really cool compiler implications. If the compiler sees a function called with the same arguments twice, it doesn't have to evaluate the function again, because it already knows the answer.
- Pattern Matching!
- Piping!

A good way to think of the `=` operator is like it used to be in algebra class. It just means that both sides are going to be the same as each other.

## GraphQL Migration: A Proper Use Case for Metaprogramming? - Shawnee Gao

It was a talk about GraphQL. I'm gonna be honest. I didn't pay a TON of attention.

## The Circle of Lifecycle Events - Nelson Wittwer

The lifecycle events and methods:

1. save
1. valid
1. before_validation
1. validate
1. after_validate
1. before_save / before_create
1. create
1. after_save / after_save / after_commit

They're good because they're easy, they're easily testable, and they run at every DB interaction
They're bad because they run at every DB interaction, there is potential for race conditions

> Callbacks should only modify the model they are defined on

If you ABSOLUTELY HAVE to modify multiple models when doing things, you, can wrap them in a transaction and use the transaction in a service object

But seriously, use service objects. There's now been two talks taht have brought this up.
They're great because

- They only have one responsibility
- They're easier to test
- Easier to version
- They can be sidestepped whenever you want
- They're not tied to every database event

They're bad because

- They're not tied to every database event
- They can be sidestepped whenever you want. These can lead to bad data conditions.
- Not vanilla rails

If these models don't live in the same app, you can use a pub/sub architecture with RabbitMQ / Kafka
